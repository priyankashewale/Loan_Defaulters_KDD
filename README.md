Loan Defaulters Prediction | Stevens Institute of Technology 
Model to predict loan defaulter cases using various features of Dataset
• Developed predictive models including Random Forest, Bagging, Logistic Regression, SVM, K-nearest
neighbor, AdaBoost Classifier, and Multilayer Perceptron.
• Aimed to predict loan defaulters by diverse models, comparing accuracy to determine the best-performing
one
